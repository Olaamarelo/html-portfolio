<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there! I'm Rafaela, and I'm on an exciting journey of self-discovery and career transformation.<br/>
  With a diploma in tourism and a lifelong background in hospitality,<br/>
  I've always been passionate about creating memorable experiences for people.<br/>
  However, I've also had a deep fascination with the world of games and technology that I can't ignore any longer.</p>

  <p>My career in hospitality has taught me invaluable skills in customer service, problem-solving, and teamwork.<br/>
    These experiences have honed my ability to adapt to ever-changing environments,<br/>
    a skill I believe will serve me well in the tech industry.</p>

  <p>Recently, I've taken a bold step into the world of programming.<br/>
    I've started to learn how to code, and I'm determined to turn my passion for technology into a full-fledged career.<br/>
    I'm confident that with my dedication and enthusiasm,<br/>
    I'll achieve my goal of becoming a programmer in the coming months/years.</p>
  
  <p>In my free time, you can find me immersed in coding tutorials, experimenting with different programming languages,<br/>
    or exploring the latest developments in the tech world.<br/>
    I thrive on challenges and believe that my diverse background <br/>
    will bring a unique perspective to the world of coding and development.</p>

  <p>I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead<br/>
    and look forward to connecting with fellow tech enthusiasts and professionals.<br/>
